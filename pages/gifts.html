  <p class="card-text">
    Many people are travelling to help celebrate our wedding, and that is the best gift of all. 
  </p>
  <p class="card-text">
    We are looking forward to a fun party with everyone!

    We don't have a gift registry, and gifts are not expected.
    If you would like to honour us with a gift, small tokens are happily accepted.
    Alternatively, a contribution to our honeymoon on Kangaroo Island, including a new tent canvas and all terrain tyres, would be greatly appreciated.
